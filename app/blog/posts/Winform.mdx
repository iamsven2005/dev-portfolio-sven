C# is a programming language that I do not like, it takes up a lot of time, reosurces and energy to run. This project is written in C#. Together with my team we develop a winform application and connect it to RPI3 using grove.

## Week 1-4 

I have completed all my school practical and created a kanban board for my team. I then made tutorial videos for my team to teach them how to use certain features of visual studio 2015. My progress has been going a bit slow but we did submit the project proposal. Excited to see what comes next!

## Week 5-6

I made a chat system, user management system dashboard, to-do list, booking system as well as approval system for the server monitoring system.
The login uses both encrytion and bcrypt hashing as well as email notification when someone has logged into the account. IOT sensor and logic are done by my teammate but the interfacing of data is done on my side.

## Week 12-13

This was my first demo presentation to showcase who did what for this C# assignment. It uses geist from vercel and heavily inspired by vercel's design choices. We decidecd to use midjourney to prompt related images.

Revamped the designed and added a few new features. Migrated booking to be a approval system to add server items. Created documentation system as well as a assignment task feature.
