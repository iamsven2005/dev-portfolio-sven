## Preface
A portfolio has always been a thing I have been looking forward to do. I did three mock-up portfolio websites already and I was thinking of settling for one last one for the next 10 years before I update again.

I did one when I was 12 using wix to build out what I thought could help me for my application process for Singapore's School of Science and Technology. It managed to help me to a certain extent but I ended up getting only on the backup list in the end.

The second one was just before school started when I wanted to show my polytechnic friends more about me and get to know me better, where I posted my codepen and freecodecamp mini projects that I tried purely using html. It had some 3d stuff and quality animations, I thought that was really cool. 

Then soon came my first year in NYP where I had the assignment to do any project I decided to build a threejs experience mostly using spline. I meant to add a hidden adventure with draggable elements and interactive gameplay with pure 3d physics engines and my first few experiences with manipulating youtube api. There was a fully built desktop environment with svg animations that change accordin to the brower and the device its on. I was fascinated by the many cool projects like bruno simons rover jounrey and many others. I showed it to my friends and they liked it. I then decided to submit it as my assignment of which my teacher graded me a C for being out of point. I was really pissed and I thought that surely she must have mixed up my project with someone else. I went to show her my final hidden game, a full stack app store with classic games like pong, Tetris and Pacman. She said "should have shown me sooner". As such I have a bit of discouragement to work on 3d rendering stuff in the browser.

## Starting Move

Now I decided was the time to make a relatively acceptable portfolio that is brings the point across. I know that in the second year of polytechnic, there will be a module called personal branding that is to be done in google sites or wix. Doing a simple benchmark shows that google sites is quite a bit better compared to wix, and top of that, wix has stupid looking trademarks all across the website. It was a no brainer to choose google sites for my portfolio. I wanted to have my portfolio to have five different aspects, a intro page, resume, blog, project page and a achievements pages.

Intro Page: I wanted it to show a bit of personality and quick showcase of my skills. I decided to make it black for dark view, with rainbow words to make it look vibrant and modern.
Resume: I think that resumes should show my work experience and skills in a easy to read format with basic information about myself.
Blog: I want it to be a nextjs dynamic routing blog to make the experience look clean.
Project Page: It should show a list of my hackathons, industry projects and school projects with basic info next to it.
Achievements Page: Should show my skills and help boost my profile.
