## Week1 
One day a message appeared in whatsapp "Also bro, I rlly think we should start a fintech biz/startup tgt". What an intresting opportunity. Edus is a friend I met in NYP, EC club and he frequently post investment videos on youtube. We started brainstorming for ideas.

## Week2
We wanted to do something with automation, ai and collaboration, maybe something like an automation tool. I build a automation tool and showed him. Together we discussed if this is a viable product. After trying to find value, we decided to scratch this idea. However we decided to call our project Bihance, shorted for business enhanced

## Week3
Maybe a HR tool would be of some use. Edus shared with me that in a previous event job, they had an unconvient way to take attendance and he felt something can be done for it. During the sememster break, we found a logo that we liked and stuck to it. We started to investgate the feasability of it.

## Week4
We crafted a plan to progress forward and we started cold calling to get feedback on our idea. I created a prototype MVP. We research more on what it takes to create a startup. Should we get a domain name? Maybe register for ACRA?

## Week5
We registered for ARCA and got our first uen, WOHOO! We signed up for a networking event at SMU and printed shirts for it.

## Week6
We went for our first networking session and I was intresting to get to know the experience from other startup founders

## Week7
We think that our management is starting to get out of hand, as such we created a shared notion to organize things in a more orderly mannner as well as did new research into which bank account we should go for.

## Week8
As part of our marketing strategy we looked into having a better seo, social media marketing as well as creating a feature request page to allow others to post what they want

## Week9
After much consideration we bought our first service, a domain name with SAV at bihance.app, and proxied it over cloudflare, we created a email account at zoho for professional emailing. We made sure it worked over the school network

## Week10
We bought our first business number to make a whatsapp business account as well as creating a pivot in strategy in our target audience. We created a drag and drop trello clone for a basic project management system

## Week12
