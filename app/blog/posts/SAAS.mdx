## Week1 
One day a message appeared in whatsapp 
"Also bro, I rlly think we should start a fintech 
biz/startup tgt". What an intresting opportunity. 
Edus is a friend I met in NYP, EC club and he frequently 
post investment videos on youtube. We started brainstorming 
for ideas.

## Week2
We wanted to do something with automation, ai and 
collaboration, maybe something like an automation tool. 
I build a automation tool and showed him. Together we 
discussed if this is a viable product. After trying to find 
value, we decided to scratch this idea. However we decided to 
call our project Bihance, shorted for business enhanced

## Week3
Maybe a HR tool would be of some use. Edus shared with me that 
in a previous event job, they had an unconvient way to take 
attendance and he felt something can be done for it. During 
the sememster break, we found a logo that we liked and stuck 
to it. We started to investgate the feasability of it.

## Week4
We crafted a plan to progress forward and we started cold 
calling to get feedback on our idea. I created a prototype MVP.
We research more on what it takes to create a startup. Should 
we get a domain name? Maybe register for ACRA?

## Week5
We registered for ARCA and got our first uen, WOHOO! We signed 
up for a networking event at SMU and printed shirts for it.

## Week6
We went for our first networking session and I was intresting 
to get to know the experience from other startup founders

## Week7
We think that our management is starting to get out of hand, 
as such we created a shared notion to organize things in a more
orderly mannner as well as did new research into which bank 
account we should go for.

## Week8
As part of our marketing strategy we looked into having a
better seo, social media marketing as well as creating a 
feature request page to allow others to post what they want

## Week9
After much consideration we bought our first service, a domain 
name with SAV at bihance.app, and proxied it over cloudflare, 
we created a email account at zoho for professional emailing. 
We made sure it worked over the school network

## Week10
We bought our first business number to make a whatsapp business 
account as well as creating a pivot in strategy in our target 
audience. We created a drag and drop trello clone for a basic 
project management system

## Week12
Joined Jumpstart workshop for the school and met with a group 
of likeminded people going for the award. Also went for the 
launch of the nyea competition where we met our mentor who will 
guide us for the competition.

## Week13

Went for NYP solve as conducted by the technoprenuership club 
and had an intresting workshop as condusted by the club as well 
as Mr Dale, the CTO of connexion. I migrated the kanban board 
to a realtime collaborative tool as well as we aquired our first 
intrest into our solutions to help them create a custom shuttle 
bus management system

## Week14

Migrated the checkin system from postgres to convex, met up 
with said client, went to Stagmond for Army related interview. 
Got our approval for CIMB bank account and will be futher 
refining our pitch for Jumpstart.

## Week15
 
Just finished the Jumpstart mock pitch and met up with some 
target users. Many of them say that they do not need to use 
our service and would prefer to stick to whatsapp as their 
main way of managing events. Its time to pivot. Took part in 
nyp solve as well a lot of divation from the original plan, 
but will still get the most of what I have. Good thing we have
not launch yet will be meeting with Ms Sun on how we can pivot.
Really hoping to use really fun stuff like convex or even 
the ai sdk by vercel. 

New Goals for this startup:
-  Learn as much as I can
-  Try my best to make use of school resources
-  Build on my skills, speed and portfolio
-  Develop something actually of value
-  Create something to fall back on if needed

## Year 1?
Eh I forgot to update this as well in awhile, basically heres the beef. Pronto said they hire us to do their work and dropped us slightly later. We joined virage as well, got good progress from there. No one was buying the idea of an end to end event management platform. Pivoted to a job finding platform and hired 2 guys for mobile dev, and we lost the second round of jumpstart.

Goals rn:
- Finishing up the mobile
- Marketing with squid game
- Sell virage and maintain the email service
