## 2020
I got my first experience of customizing themes and styles with CMS like shopify square space and wix, mainly doing style changes with google sites for documentation of secondary school projects. All weebly styling is just copy and paste by school requirements.

## 2021
Got introduced to the world of threejs and css where I grinded css battles every day for 3 month and got top leaderboard for a week. I heavily did my animations and graphics with svg and js transform.

## 2022
I mainly stuck to bootstrap for now, optimizing my icons with font awesome as well as using bootstrap templates from the community by copy pasting.

## 2023
I tried my hands at a large variety of tools, creating my own CSS in js, postcss, pre and post compiled css, as well as trying out spline as a ui based component

## 2024
Mainly using shadcn and tailwind for now, I heavily modify shadecn styles with diasyui for a better themeing and components-based design, allowing me to progress better than bootstrap.
