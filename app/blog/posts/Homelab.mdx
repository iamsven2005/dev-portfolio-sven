# Shopaholic Journey: From Pixel to Homelab

## 📱 My Pixel Detour

When my Oppo broke, I went for a **Google Pixel 6a (\$600)**. Back then, I could’ve gotten a Xiaomi with the same specs for less, but paranoia about Chinese brands (cybersecurity news, spyware fears, etc.) swayed me. Ironically, I’m much more relaxed about it now.

Overall? Solid experience. Smooth browser, no lock-in, Apple-like feel. Only downside is the social sharing gap (no AirDrop).

---

## 🖱️ Of Mice, Keyboards & Poly Life

* Initially dreamed of **Logitech G502**, but I wasn’t gaming.
* Influencers pushed me towards the **MX Master 3s + MX Mini combo**. Game-changer for productivity. Heavy, professional, premium.
* But too much efficiency = stress. During poly, I toned it down.

---

## 💻 Laptop Choices

* **Budget:** \$1.5k from my \$3k savings.
* **Pick:** IdeaPad 514LT7, Intel i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD. Stable but not the best value (Ryzen/Aftershock would’ve been smarter).
* Later flex: **ThinkPad X1 Carbon** — silky build, perfect with MX Master.

## 🎮 Dad’s Legion 5

Dad bought a **Legion 5** for design. Lucky for me, I could finally game. Steam ran smooth, no more negative FPS like my IdeaPad. Racing in F1 with a GameSir made me get the hype.

## 🖥️ PC & Homelab Rabbit Hole

![Head](https://dev-portfolio-sven.vercel.app/head.jpeg)

### Day 1 – \$0.50

Before jumping into another device, I had to ask myself: *what’s the real purpose of this remote setup?*

I already own three laptops, and my Pixel phone alone covers most daily computing needs — solid RAM, camera, storage, and even AI features built right in. Do I really need a fourth machine?

The answer lies in **dependability and future-proofing**:

* A system that’s **always on**.
* Flexible enough to **expand later**.
* Something I can **rely on daily**, not just another idle gadget.

And what’s the first requirement for such a setup? **Internet.** Preferably a wired connection via RJ45 for stability. So I decided to start small — picking up a **bag of RJ45 connectors on Taobao for just \$0.50**.

A modest beginning, but every setup starts with the basics.

![Sockets](https://dev-portfolio-sven.vercel.app/homelab1.jpg)

### Day 2 – \$30.50
So my house hardware shop was closing down, and there were decent deals available.
- CMOS 2023 battery pack for $5 (Things in singapore are expensive)
- Extention cord for $15
- Cat6 10m wire, enough to crimp to my hearts content $6
- Multi-adapter for future mishaps or poor planning $4
I did a quick survey of where this "Thing" is supposed to be, and ended up decided to use my desk as "The place"
- It's close to my current setup
- It's cooler in my room and wont really disrupt anything elsewhere except myself
- Connect to the only monitor in my house
On my wall, I have two wall sockets, and not a whole lot of space to play with.

### Day 3 – \$600.50

This project is starting to burn the wallet a bit, but here’s the plan. The network flow goes like this: **ISP → house modem → repeater → wall → network switch**. To make that happen, I picked up:

* **TP-Link RE300 Repeater** – \$100
* **ASUS TUF Gaming BE6500 Dual Band WiFi 7 Router** – \$350
* **Huawei HG8240 Series ONT** – \$100
* **D-Link DMS-105 Switch** – \$20

(I’m not counting mouse, keyboard, or monitor costs here.)

![Crimper](https://dev-portfolio-sven.vercel.app/crimper.jpeg)

---

### Day 4 – \$700.50

With networking gear sorted, it’s time to get hands-on. I grabbed a **crimping tool + testing kit** for about \$100. This will let me terminate my own Cat6 cables with RJ45 connectors and do some simple network runs.

The target? To have my setup consistently running at **2.5 Gbps**.

---

# ⚡ Why 2.5 Gbps Became the Sweet Spot

1. **Backwards Compatibility with Cat5e**

   * Works with old wiring without re-cabling.
   * Delivers \~2.5× faster speeds with no infrastructure changes.

2. **Wi-Fi 6/6E Backhaul**

   * Modern access points push beyond 1 Gbps.
   * 2.5G uplink is the affordable, practical middle ground.

3. **Lower Power & Heat**

   * Easier to cool, better for silent consumer gear and homelabs.

4. **Cost Efficiency**

   * Much cheaper than 5G/10G hardware, but a big jump over 1G.

5. **Industry Adoption**

   * Pushed by the NBASE-T Alliance; widely compatible today.

6. **Practical Speeds**

   * Perfect for SSDs, NAS, and 2 Gbps fiber plans.
   * Few home users need more unless doing enterprise work.

✅ **In short:** 2.5 Gbps is the practical bridge between legacy 1 Gbps and high-end 10 Gbps — affordable, plug-and-play, and more than enough for most homelabs.

![Screwset](https://dev-portfolio-sven.vercel.app/screwset.jpeg)

### Day 5 – \$705

With the hardware store about to close, I made one last quick run:

* **\$0.50 roll of tape**
* **\$4 screwset (31 pieces)** — covers most PC screw sizes.

That brings me to **\$705 in** so far… and still nothing is actually usable yet. Time to start planning for the **first real device** soon.

### Day 6 – \$750

I bought some HDMI and Thunderbolt cables, which are always a good investment, and did some research. Well, something I have always wanted is more storage, not counting them into the total cost, I have 4 1 TB Seagate drives lying around.
That's when it hit me: I should start with a file server—something lightweight, affordable, and excellent for serving files. Having a server is not it, and neither is a desktop/workstation. And am I really that geeked out to run a Rpi server?
Also, I don't have enough spare phones to run this, so I'll have to look into finding a mini-PC for this task. Well there's this brand that I have always liked it's motto that seemed perfect for this job. A small intel pc, with 2gb ports, hdmi and 4 usb would be what I am looking for.

![Nas](https://dev-portfolio-sven.vercel.app/nas.jpeg)


### Day 7 – \$855

Today marks the start of my actual **homelab build** with a small NAS system, powered by a **Trigkey N100 mini-PC** I picked up from Amazon for around **\$150**. It runs on an Intel N100 (4 cores / 4 threads) — very power efficient, but not exactly built for heavy multitasking.

For storage, I’ve set it up with:

* **4 × 1TB HDDs** in a **RAID 10** array (a balance of performance + redundancy).
* **1 × 500GB HDD** mounted separately for lighter, non-critical tasks.

This gives me two mount points:

* RAID 10 → main storage
* 500GB → misc storage

---

#### ✅ Pros of the Trigkey N100

* **Very efficient:** \~6–10W idle, \~20W under load.
* **Silent & compact:** easy to hide on a shelf or corner.
* **Low cost entry point** into homelabs.
* Great for **light services**: file storage, Pi-hole, Docker with low concurrency, Nextcloud, etc.

#### ⚠️ Cons of the Trigkey N100

* Only **4c/4t**, weak at parallel loads.
* **Limited expandability:** max 16–32GB RAM, single NVMe slot.
* **Not ideal** for CPU-heavy work: media transcoding, AI inference, or big DBs.
* **Shared resources:** RAID I/O can saturate it quickly.

---

#### 🛠️ Setup Journey

1. Installed **Ubuntu Server** over ethernet, then moved it to WiFi to keep it as an **isolated island**.
2. Connected it back via **Tailscale** as an edge node.
3. Deployed **AdGuard** to run DHCP and route Tailscale traffic through it.
4. Installed **Active Directory** and enabled an **SMB share** on the 500GB disk for multi-device access.
5. Added **Filebrowser**, mapped to the RAID 10 array, with a daemon to survive reboots, proxied via ngrok.
6. Installed **Cockpit** for quick phone-based monitoring.

---

#### 🌡️ Long-Term Reliability Considerations

To make the NAS last, I focused on **heat and electricity**:

* HDDs spaced apart for better airflow.
* Smaller-capacity disks = less CPU strain, less heat.
* RAID config chosen for balance of redundancy and reduced load on the N100.
* HDDs are cheaper than SSDs — and for now, more cost-effective.

Security-wise, I sandboxed it: endpoint antivirus + IDS/IPS. Worst case, only my \$150 NAS gets hit.

---

With this, my **first real homelab node is alive** 🎉. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s a dependable starting point. From here, I can expand and layer more services over time.


### Day 7 – \$860

Some to give you guys some context here is what raiding means in "My World"

- ⚡ RAID Levels Explained

### RAID 0 – **Striping**

* **How it works:** Splits data across 2+ drives.
* **Pros:** Fastest read/write speed, full storage capacity.
* **Cons:** Zero redundancy — if one drive fails, all data is lost.
* **Use case:** Temporary scratch disks, gaming, or fast caches where data isn’t critical.

---

### RAID 1 – **Mirroring**

* **How it works:** Each drive has an exact copy (2 drives minimum).
* **Pros:** High redundancy (safe if 1 drive fails), simple to set up.
* **Cons:** Storage efficiency = 50% (2× 2TB = only 2TB usable).
* **Use case:** Important small-scale systems (boot drives, business PCs, critical docs).

---

### RAID 5 – **Striping + Parity**

* **How it works:** Spreads data across 3+ drives with 1 drive worth of parity.
* **Pros:** Redundancy with good storage efficiency (\~67–80%), decent read speed.
* **Cons:** Write speed slower (parity calc), rebuilds can stress drives. If 2 drives fail = data loss.
* **Use case:** Home/SMB NAS where capacity + redundancy are both important.

---

### RAID 6 – **Double Parity**

* **How it works:** Like RAID 5, but with 2 drives worth of parity.
* **Pros:** Survives 2 drive failures. Safer for large arrays.
* **Cons:** More storage overhead, slower writes.
* **Use case:** Enterprise NAS, archival storage with many disks.

---

### RAID 10 – **Striping + Mirroring**

* **How it works:** Combines RAID 1 and 0 (4+ drives).
* **Pros:** Fast + redundant, quick rebuilds.
* **Cons:** 50% efficiency, needs more drives.
* **Use case:** High-performance setups where uptime + speed both matter (databases, VMs).

---

### Other RAID Levels

* **RAID 50/60:** Hybrid of RAID 5/6 with striping across groups. Used in big storage arrays.
* **JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks):** No RAID, just combines drives into one big volume.

---

# 🆚 RAID vs Other Storage Systems

### 🔹 Unraid

* **How it works:** Each drive has its own file system; one or two drives provide parity.
* **Pros:**

  * Add different-sized disks freely.
  * Only parity drives need to be as big as your largest disk.
  * If multiple drives fail, you still keep data from unaffected drives.
* **Cons:**

  * Slower writes (unless using cache SSD).
  * Not true RAID performance.
* **Use case:** Great for **home NAS with mixed disks**, media servers, expandable storage.

---

### 🔹 TrueNAS (FreeNAS) + ZFS

* **ZFS is both a file system and volume manager** with integrated RAID-like features.
* **Pros:**

  * End-to-end data integrity (checksums, self-healing).
  * Advanced RAID options (RAID-Z1, Z2, Z3).
  * Snapshots & replication built in.
* **Cons:**

  * Needs lots of RAM (1GB per TB recommended).
  * Complex for beginners.
* **Use case:** Rock-solid NAS, business-grade storage, archival, enterprise homelabs.

---

### 🔹 ZFS RAID-Z (RAID 5/6 Equivalent)

* **RAID-Z1:** Like RAID 5 (1 disk parity).
* **RAID-Z2:** Like RAID 6 (2 disk parity).
* **RAID-Z3:** Triple parity, very safe but more overhead.
* **Benefit:** Better at avoiding “RAID write hole” (corruption during rebuild).

---

### Quick Comparison

| System      | Expandable | Performance         | Fault Tolerance  | Best For                |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| RAID 0      | No         | 🚀🚀🚀              | ❌ None           | Speed only              |
| RAID 1      | No         | 🚀🚀                | ✅ 1 drive fail   | Small but critical      |
| RAID 5      | No         | 🚀🚀                | ✅ 1 drive fail   | Balanced home NAS       |
| RAID 6      | No         | 🚀                  | ✅ 2 drives fail  | Large arrays            |
| RAID 10     | No         | 🚀🚀🚀              | ✅ 1 per mirror   | Fast + safe, but costly |
| Unraid      | ✅ Yes      | 🚀 (with SSD cache) | ✅ 1–2 drive fail | Flexible mixed disks    |
| ZFS/TrueNAS | Limited    | 🚀🚀                | ✅ up to 3 drives | Enterprise-grade        |

---

# ✅ TL;DR

* **RAID 0/1/5/6/10** = classic hardware/software RAID, but rigid (all disks should be same size).
* **Unraid** = flexible, easy to expand with mixed disks, great for homelabs.
* **TrueNAS/ZFS** = enterprise-level integrity + features, best if you want **serious data protection**.

I mnted seagate to /mnt, set fstab as service
I then forgot about it and added 5 more disks, tried a raid 10, of course, it wouldn't work.
I thought the tailscale issue, so I went to 0 superblock. The UUID of the disk surely changes.
I then proceeded to make NTFS of it, and it confirmed fail, but Idk why (conflict proc), then I tried sudo reboot cause of tailscale. 
fstab confirm crash the whole pc. Now remember by tailscale routes through nas a dhcp, so whole lan kenna crash. 
Now I panic because no lan, no outbound. Then I understood why. Wasted whole day but using raid 5 now waiting for 9.9 sales. Shifted homelab from living room because I have singtel wifi for a reason.
Therefore, I transitioned it to a ZFS file system. Spent $5 on a blow brush for dusting off stuff in the future.

### Day 8 – \$880

# ⚡ Power, Resilience, and Why a UPS Matters for Your Homelab

When building a homelab or even just a reliable home PC setup, one of the most overlooked components isn’t a CPU or GPU — it’s **power protection**. Let’s break down why.

---

## 🔌 What Is a UPS?

A **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** is more than just a fancy power strip. It’s essentially a **battery backup** combined with power conditioning:

* **Battery Backup:** Keeps your devices alive for a few minutes (or hours, depending on size) when wall power cuts out. That gives you time to **save work, safely shut down, or ride through a short outage**.
* **Power Conditioning:** Filters out spikes, dips, and surges in the incoming electricity so your devices get **clean, stable voltage**.

Think of it as a shock absorber for your electronics — smoothing the ride between your wall socket and your PC/NAS.

---

## ⚠️ Why Wall Power Is “Dirty”

The electricity that comes out of your wall isn’t as perfect as we imagine. It’s considered **“dirty” power** because it fluctuates due to:

* **Voltage spikes** (lightning strikes, heavy appliances switching on).
* **Brownouts** (temporary low voltage during high demand).
* **Electrical noise** (microwaves, fridges, motors feeding interference into the line).

Your devices might survive these hiccups day-to-day, but over time they **degrade power supplies, shorten component lifespan, and corrupt data during outages**.

---

## 🛡️ What Is Resilience in Computing?

**Resilience** means your system can continue operating — or at least recover gracefully — even when something goes wrong.

For homelabs, resilience =

* Surviving power outages without corrupting drives.
* Keeping services (NAS, DNS, VMs) running during short blackouts.
* Preventing hardware stress from repeated restarts.

Without resilience, a single power flicker can lead to **RAID rebuilds, file system corruption, or even fried components**.

---

## 💾 How Different Memory/Storage Types React to Power Outages

Not all data lives in the same kind of “memory.” Here’s how each behaves when the lights go out:

### 1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

* **Volatile** → Data is lost instantly when power cuts.
* **Impact of outage:** Open documents, running apps, and in-memory processes vanish.
* **Resilience fix:** Save frequently, use autosave features, or keep a UPS to avoid sudden shutdowns.

---

### 2. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**

* **Mechanical platters + read/write heads.**
* **Impact of outage:** If power cuts mid-write, the head may not park properly → **data corruption** or physical disk damage.
* **Resilience fix:** UPS allows graceful shutdown and head parking. Journaling file systems (ext4, NTFS) help recover but aren’t perfect.

---

### 3. **SSD (SATA SSD)**

* **Flash storage with controller & cache.**
* **Impact of outage:** Incomplete writes can corrupt files or even the translation layer (FAT/metadata). Some drives lose cache data.
* **Resilience fix:** Enterprise SSDs often include **power-loss protection capacitors**. For consumer SSDs, a UPS reduces the risk.

---

### 4. **NVMe SSD**

* Same risks as SSD, but faster → more data in flight when power drops.
* **Impact of outage:** Higher chance of corruption if writes are interrupted.
* **Resilience fix:** UPS or capacitors in high-end drives.

---

### 5. **VRAM (GPU Memory)**

* Like RAM, it’s **volatile**.
* **Impact of outage:** No long-term risk, but you lose whatever was being processed (e.g., rendering, AI inference).
* **Resilience fix:** UPS is only relevant if you need GPUs to finish jobs cleanly.

---

## 📝 Putting It Together

* **RAM/VRAM** → volatile, always wiped during outages.
* **HDD/SSD/NVMe** → non-volatile, but can get **corrupted mid-write**.
* **UPS** = protects against both **data loss** (by giving you time to save/flush writes) and **hardware stress** (by filtering dirty power).

---

## ✅ TL;DR

A UPS isn’t a luxury — it’s a **resilience enabler**.

* Wall power is unstable (“dirty”), which wears down electronics.
* A UPS keeps your system alive during outages, giving you time to save data and shut down cleanly.
* RAM and VRAM lose data instantly, while HDDs/SSDs/NVMes risk corruption without proper shutdown.

**If you value your homelab, NAS, or even just your main PC, a UPS is one of the smartest investments you can make.**

Eaton is considered one of the better UPS brands because it blends enterprise-grade reliability, pure sine wave output, better efficiency, and longer warranties,
often at competitive pricing. APC remains the popular household brand, but Eaton is the go-to when you want something that feels closer to datacenter quality
for your homelab or critical devices.

After the scare that was yesterday, I decided to buy a ups as well for future proofing of devices for shorter downtimes. $20

### Day 9 – \$1,350

Ironwolf pro 18tb $470


# Why I Chose Seagate (IronWolf Pro) for My NAS — and Why 18TB Is the Sweet Spot

I’ve been slowly shaping my homelab into something I can actually rely on day-to-day. The heart of it is a NAS I first stood up on a **Trigkey N100**: low power, quiet, and perfect for learning. I started with mixed HDDs (RAID10 + a separate 500 GB volume), then set my sights on **proper NAS-grade drives** as I scale capacity.

Before the choice, I had to clarify the tech:

## CMR vs SMR vs HAMR (super short)

* **CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording):** non-overlapping tracks → **consistent writes**, great for RAID/NAS.
* **SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording):** overlapping tracks → higher density but **slower/random writes**; rebuilds can be painful.
* **HAMR (Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording):** laser-assisted writes for **ultra-high capacities**; exciting, but newer and pricier.

For a NAS that will rebuild, scrub, and serve mixed workloads, **CMR is the safe, boring, and correct choice**.

## So… why **Seagate**, specifically?

I went with **Seagate IronWolf Pro** because it hits the NAS checklist without drama:

* **All-CMR in this tier:** No surprise SMR models sneaking into arrays that need steady random writes and clean rebuilds.
* **NAS-tuned firmware (AgileArray):** Optimized for multi-bay vibration, RAID behavior, and quick error handling—exactly what you want during rebuilds.
* **Vibration & 24/7 ratings:** Built for always-on enclosures; RV sensors and higher endurance/workload ratings than typical desktop drives.
* **IronWolf Health Management:** Extra telemetry/health hooks (works best with popular NAS OSes), useful for pre-fail warnings.
* **Rescue Data Recovery (often included for a couple of years):** Not a plan to fail, but a real backstop if the worst happens.
* **Availability & value:** In SG, IronWolf Pro is easy to source, frequently discounted, and **price/TB is competitive** versus other NAS lines.

Bottom line: Seagate’s **IronWolf Pro** gives me predictable CMR performance, NAS-specific features, and better guardrails if something goes sideways—exactly what I want when my array is rebuilding at 3 AM.

## Why **18 TB** is my current sweet spot

I picked up **18 TB** at **\~S\$24/TB** — and here’s why that capacity makes sense:

1. **Best value curve right now:** Below 16 TB, \$/TB is usually worse; above 18–20 TB, you start paying early-adopter tax.
2. **CMR + sanity:** Many 18 TB SKUs are CMR, so I get NAS-friendly behavior without stepping into newer HAMR pricing.
3. **Rebuild risk vs time:** Bigger drives mean longer rebuilds (and higher second-failure risk). **18 TB is still manageable** compared to 20–22 TB, especially on modest CPUs like my N100.
4. **Planning headroom:** With 18 TB units, even a small 3-bay gives real, future-proof capacity (and I can still move to ZFS RAIDZ2 later if I expand).

## My setup story (the short version)

* **Compute:** Trigkey N100 NAS (quiet, \~6–20 W), later pairing with beefier nodes (Evo X1) for heavier tasks.
* **Disks:** Moving from a learning RAID10 to **IronWolf Pro** as I consolidate and scale.
* **Network:** Targeting **2.5 GbE** as the practical sweet spot—works on existing cabling, cheap NICs/switches, fast enough for SSD-backed shares.
* **Power:** Lining up an **Eaton UPS** so rebuilds and writes survive brownouts (clean shutdowns > corrupted arrays).

If you’re building similar: pick **CMR** for NAS, lean into **IronWolf Pro** for the NAS-specific perks and recovery safety net, and don’t sleep on **18 TB** while the price curve is friendly. Your future self (and your rebuild times) will thank you.

### Day 10 – \$1,360

Here’s a cleaned-up rephrase for **Day 10**, with an expanded section on different ways HDDs can be stored and used:

---

### Day 10 – \$1,360

Picked up a **Maiwo HDD enclosure for \$10**.
This was honestly the hardest decision so far — there are just so many brands, so many form factors, and endless “future-proof” options. But at the end of the day, I decided to stay practical: who really needs more than **30 TB of local data** in a home setup, especially when I still use cloud services?

---

## 🗂️ Different Ways to Store & Use HDDs

When it comes to spinning disks, there isn’t a single “right” way — it all depends on your budget, use case, and how much resilience you want:

### 🔹 NAS (Network Attached Storage)

* A purpose-built enclosure with its own OS (Synology, QNAP, or DIY TrueNAS).
* Provides redundancy (RAID/ZFS), network sharing, snapshots, and remote access.
* Best for **always-on home or office setups** where multiple users/devices need reliable storage.

### 🔹 Dedicated Mini PC as a NAS

* Using a small PC (like my Trigkey N100 or Evo X1) with Linux/TrueNAS/Unraid.
* More flexible: can run extra services (Docker, VMs) alongside storage.
* Slightly more complex than a consumer NAS, but **better value and customizable**.

### 🔹 Docking Stations

* A “toaster-style” dock where you slot in bare drives (single or dual bay).
* Great for **quick backups, cloning, or temporary access**.
* Not designed for 24/7 uptime — drives are exposed, no cooling, limited redundancy.

### 🔹 Open Drive Arrays (JBOD / DIY Racks)

* Barebone chassis or open trays holding multiple drives.
* Often paired with a dedicated controller card or HBA.
* Cheaper and highly expandable, but requires **manual configuration** (RAID, cooling, power).

### 🔹 Direct Wire Connection

* Plugging bare drives directly into a motherboard or via SATA-to-USB adapters.
* Cheap, quick, but messy and fragile for long-term use.
* Good for **data recovery or one-time migrations**, not as primary storage.

### 🔹 External Enclosures

* Like my Maiwo: sealed cases (single or multi-bay) that connect via USB-C, Thunderbolt, or eSATA.
* Protects drives, adds cooling, and makes them portable.
* Ideal balance for **individuals who don’t want a full NAS but still need reliable storage expansion**.

Here’s a **blog-style summary** that gives a digestible overview of **S2D, Ceph, and vSAN**, plus why consensus matters in distributed storage:

---

# 🌀 S2D vs. Ceph vs. vSAN – A Quick Guide to Distributed Storage

When you scale storage beyond a single box, you enter the world of **distributed storage systems**. Three big names often come up: **Microsoft S2D (Storage Spaces Direct), Ceph, and VMware vSAN**. They all serve the same purpose — pooling disks across multiple servers into one resilient storage fabric — but they do it in different ways.

---

## 🔹 Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)

* **What it is:** Microsoft’s software-defined storage built into Windows Server Datacenter.
* **How it works:** Pools local disks across Windows cluster nodes, presenting them as highly available storage volumes. Uses **ReFS/NTFS** plus **SMB3** for data access.
* **Why people choose it:**

  * Deep integration with **Windows ecosystem** (Hyper-V, Active Directory).
  * Easy to manage with Windows Admin Center.
  * Licensing often bundled with Datacenter edition.
* **Best for:** Enterprises already invested heavily in **Microsoft infrastructure**.

---

## 🔹 Ceph

* **What it is:** Open-source, massively scalable distributed storage system.
* **How it works:** Uses **RADOS** (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store) to spread objects across nodes with replication or erasure coding. Exposes storage as **block (RBD), object (S3/Swift), or file (CephFS)**.
* **Why people choose it:**

  * **Flexibility + scale** — runs on commodity hardware, scales to petabytes.
  * Widely used in **OpenStack, Kubernetes, and homelabs**.
  * Open-source community with lots of tunability.
* **Best for:** Organizations needing **cloud-style storage on commodity gear** or open-source enthusiasts.

---

## 🔹 VMware vSAN

* **What it is:** VMware’s hyper-converged storage solution.
* **How it works:** Aggregates local disks of ESXi hosts into a shared datastore managed at the hypervisor layer. Uses **VMware clustering & DRS** for performance and resilience.
* **Why people choose it:**

  * Tight integration with **VMware vSphere**.
  * Single-pane-of-glass management for compute + storage.
  * Certified hardware = predictable performance.
* **Best for:** Enterprises standardizing on **VMware virtualization** and looking for simplicity.

---

# 🔑 Why Consensus Is Needed

Distributed storage relies on multiple servers (nodes) working together. To maintain **consistency and reliability**, the system needs **consensus** — an agreement between nodes about the current state of the data.

### Without consensus, you risk:

* **Split-brain scenarios:** Two nodes think they own the “truth” → data divergence.
* **Silent corruption:** Writes acknowledged by one node but not replicated.
* **Inconsistent recovery:** After failures, nodes disagree on which version of the data is valid.

### How consensus is achieved

* **Quorums:** Majority of nodes must agree before a write is considered committed.
* **Algorithms:** Paxos, Raft, and variations (Ceph uses CRUSH maps + monitors, vSAN/S2D use quorum + witness nodes).
* **Purpose:** Ensures that even if some nodes fail, the cluster agrees on the single, correct version of data.

File systems are one of those things we all use daily but rarely stop to compare. Here’s a **blog-style comparison** of common ones:

# 🗂️ File Systems and How They Interact with RAID, ZFS, and Unraid

When you put multiple drives together, you need both a **storage strategy** (RAID, Unraid, ZFS) and a **file system** (ext4, NTFS, etc.). They work at different layers:

* **RAID/Unraid/ZFS** → decides *how disks are combined* (striped, mirrored, parity, object store).
* **File system** → decides *how files are organized on top* (journaling, snapshots, metadata).

---

## 🔹 Classic RAID (0/1/5/6/10) + File Systems

* Traditional RAID is handled by hardware controllers or software RAID (mdadm in Linux).
* Once the array is created, you format it with a **file system** like ext4, NTFS, or XFS.
* The file system is unaware it’s running on a RAID — it just sees one “big disk.”

**Example:**

* Linux NAS → RAID 10 via `mdadm` → formatted with **ext4**.
* Windows Server → RAID 5 on hardware → formatted with **NTFS**.

✅ **Good for:** Simple, predictable setups.
⚠️ **Limitations:** RAID doesn’t protect against *silent corruption*; it only handles drive failure.

---

## 🔹 ZFS (Integrated FS + RAID)

* ZFS is **both a file system and volume manager**.
* It has its own RAID-like layers (RAID-Z1, RAID-Z2, etc.), no need for separate RAID.
* Built-in features:

  * End-to-end **checksumming** (detects + corrects corruption).
  * **Snapshots** and cloning.
  * Compression and deduplication.

✅ **Good for:** Data integrity, enterprise NAS, archival.
⚠️ **Limitations:** High RAM requirement (rule of thumb: 1 GB RAM per 1 TB storage).

**Why people love ZFS:** If you write a file, ZFS can verify later that it hasn’t silently corrupted — something RAID + ext4/NTFS can’t guarantee.

---

## 🔹 Unraid (Flexible Array + File System Choice)

* Unlike RAID, Unraid stores each disk with its **own file system** (commonly XFS, sometimes Btrfs).
* Parity is calculated separately, not striping across all disks.
* This means:

  * You can mix and match disk sizes.
  * If multiple disks fail, the unaffected disks are still readable individually.

✅ **Good for:** Homelabs, mixed drives, expandable storage.
⚠️ **Limitations:** Slower writes unless you use an SSD cache; not as fast as RAID10 or ZFS.

**Why file system choice matters in Unraid:**

* **XFS** = stable, simple, high performance.
* **Btrfs** = snapshots, CoW, but heavier and less mature under constant RAID stress.

---

## 🔹 How ext4, NTFS, XFS, Btrfs fit in

* **ext4:** Default Linux FS; reliable choice for software RAID arrays.
* **NTFS:** Windows-only; common for hardware RAID on Windows servers.
* **XFS:** Strong performance with large files, used in many NAS distros (e.g., Unraid).
* **Btrfs:** Modern Linux FS with built-in RAID features, but less robust than ZFS.

| Approach         | Handles RAID       | File System(s) Used | Strengths                 | Weaknesses           |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Classic RAID** | Separate (HW/SW)   | ext4, NTFS, XFS     | Simple, familiar          | No corruption checks |
| **ZFS**          | Integrated         | ZFS (only)          | Data integrity, snapshots | RAM-hungry           |
| **Unraid**       | Flexible, per-disk | XFS, Btrfs          | Mix sizes, easy recovery  | Slower writes        |
| **Btrfs RAID**   | Integrated         | Btrfs               | Snapshots, CoW            | Not as proven as ZFS |

# 🏡 File Systems, RAID, and My Homelab Choices

When I started my homelab on the **Trigkey N100**, I knew storage would be the heart of it. I had five HDDs on hand, so I went with a **RAID 10** setup for balance — decent performance and redundancy, without overloading the N100’s modest CPU.

## 🔹 Why ext4 Made Sense (for Now)

I formatted my RAID 10 array with **ext4**, the Linux default. It’s:

* Lightweight and reliable.
* Well-supported across every distro.
* Easy to recover with standard Linux tools.

For a beginner-friendly NAS build, ext4 just works.

⚠️ Limitation: ext4 doesn’t detect **silent corruption**. If a bit flips on disk, RAID won’t catch it, and ext4 won’t notice until it’s too late.

---

## 🔹 When I Might Want ZFS

Down the road, I see myself moving to **ZFS** when I add bigger disks (like the 18TB IronWolf Pro I’m eyeing). Why?

* **Data integrity:** End-to-end checksums mean I’ll know if files silently corrupt.
* **Snapshots & cloning:** Perfect for testing, backups, or rolling back a bad config.
* **RAID-Z:** Safer rebuilds compared to mdadm RAID 5/6.

⚠️ Trade-off: ZFS eats RAM (rule of thumb: 1 GB RAM per 1 TB of storage). My N100 can’t handle it gracefully, so I’d need to run ZFS on a beefier box (like my Evo X1 or a future node).

---

## 🔹 Why Not Unraid (Yet)

Unraid is tempting, especially since I’ve collected a mix of drive sizes. Its flexibility — letting each disk keep its own file system (usually XFS) with parity on top — is attractive.

* I could add drives one by one, no need for identical sizes.
* If two drives fail, the rest are still mountable individually.
* Easy to expand as my homelab grows.

⚠️ Limitation: Unraid isn’t as fast for writes unless you use SSD cache. Since I’m running on budget gear and want consistent speeds, I stuck with RAID10 for now.

---

## 🔹 Where Btrfs Fits In

Some NAS distros default to **Btrfs** for snapshots and CoW (copy-on-write). But it’s still not as mature as ZFS in heavy RAID use. For my setup, ext4 is simpler and safer.

That said, I might experiment with Btrfs on smaller pools or SSDs later, especially for snapshotting configs.

---

## ✅ My Homelab Storage Journey (So Far)

* **Today:** Trigkey N100 → 4×1TB RAID10 → formatted with ext4.
* **Next step:** Expand with IronWolf Pro drives, consider migrating to ZFS on Evo X1 for integrity + snapshots.
* **Future option:** Try Unraid when I start mixing odd drive sizes or want per-disk flexibility.

---

👉 In short: **ext4 fits my current lightweight NAS**, but as my homelab grows, **ZFS will protect my bigger investments**, and **Unraid may be my playground for flexibility**.


### Day 11 – \$1,960

Today was a **big spend day**: I picked up **2 × Lexar 870 SSDs for \$600**.
It felt like a leap, but it’s an investment in reliability and efficiency for where my homelab is headed.

---

## 🔹 Why Lexar Over Samsung 990?

Most people default to **Samsung NVMe drives** like the 980/990 series because of speed benchmarks. But for a homelab — especially one that might evolve into an **AI-focused system** — raw speed isn’t everything.

* **Power efficiency:** Lexar SSDs are tuned for lower idle and sustained power draw. For 24/7 systems like NAS or Unraid arrays, that translates into cooler temps and less wasted energy.
* **Reliability under load:** Unlike ultra-high-performance consumer NVMes (e.g., Samsung 990 Pro) that chase peak speeds, Lexar focuses on **consistent sustained performance**. That matters more for AI datasets and NAS workloads, where stability is king.
* **Value-oriented design:** Lexar drives tend to offer a better balance of **endurance (TBW)** and cost, making them attractive for longer-term deployments where drives will constantly read/write.

---

## 🔹 Storage Philosophy – What Belongs Where

Not all data deserves the same type of storage. Here’s how I’m planning mine:

* **HDDs (IronWolf Pro, etc.):**

  * Great for **bulk data** — movies, backups, archival, cold storage.
  * Cheap per TB, but slower and fragile under sudden power loss.

* **SATA SSDs (like Lexar 870):**

  * Best for **NAS caches, VM storage, system volumes**.
  * Much faster than HDDs, but without the heat/noise of NVMe.

* **NVMe SSDs (Samsung 980/990, etc.):**

  * Best for **scratch space, AI model training, database indexing**.
  * Incredible speed, but higher heat and power draw.

* **VRAM (GPU memory):**

  * Used for **AI inference and rendering**.
  * Ephemeral — wiped on power loss, but essential for real-time workloads.

---

## 🔹 Why Lexar Works Well with Unraid

Unraid thrives on mixing different drives, and Lexar SSDs slot in perfectly:

* As a **cache drive**, they buffer fast writes before moving them to slower HDD arrays.
* As a **VM/dockers pool**, they provide reliable low-latency storage for apps, databases, or AI containers.
* Their efficiency means **less stress on UPS runtime** in case of power outages — important for homelab resilience.

---

## 🔹 The Values Behind Lexar

Lexar has always branded itself around **reliability, accessibility, and endurance**. Unlike consumer gaming SSDs that market maximum read/write speeds, Lexar’s pitch is:

* **Consistent performance over flashy peaks**.
* **Durability for 24/7 use cases**.
* **Affordable pro-grade hardware** for creators, engineers, and homelab enthusiasts.

For me, those values align with what I want: a setup that runs **quiet, cool, and stable** while I experiment with NAS, AI inference, and Unraid services.

---

## 🔹 Why It Matters for AI

AI workloads thrive on **predictability** — the ability to stream datasets in and out of storage without bottlenecks or overheating. Lexar SSDs:

* Provide **stable I/O throughput**, reducing training/inference hiccups.
* Save energy, which matters when GPUs are already consuming most of the power budget.
* Fit well in **edge-AI setups** or small servers where efficiency > chasing PCIe 5.0 bragging rights.
